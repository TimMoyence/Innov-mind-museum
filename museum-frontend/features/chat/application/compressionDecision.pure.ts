/**
 * Pure compression-decision module (no React, no expo) — W1-D1FE-01.
 *
 * Given a resolved DataMode and whether WebP encoding is supported on this
 * platform, it yields the compression profile(s) the adaptive optimizer should
 * apply before upload:
 *
 * - low / edge → TWO outputs: a small upload (~1024px WebP q~0.60 ~150KB) AND a
 *   larger `localDerivative` (~1280px WebP q~0.70 250-400KB) handed to the
 *   carnet (cluster E). When WebP is unsupported both fall back to JPEG.
 * - normal → the LEGACY single output (1600px JPEG 2.7MB, no derivative).
 *
 * It is intentionally side-effect-free so the choice can be unit-tested and
 * reused from any picker without pulling in the expo manipulator.
